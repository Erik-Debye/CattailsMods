# CattailsMods
A colection of self-made mods for Cattails the game. Each mod includes an install directory and uninstall directory

INSTALLATION 

Materials/Software required: 
1. Undertales Mod Tool found here: https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool/releases Please use the latest release and the 'net bundled' version. This version will install all needed dependencies to decompile and recompile the code. Make sure to extract its contents. 
2. Hg Patcher found here:~~https://github.com/SolventMercury/HgPatcher/releases~~ Please download the file 'HGPatcher.csx'
   **EDIT 5/13/22**: Please use the script found here in my work for the time being [See Issue #1 for Details]: https://github.com/Erik-Debye/HgPatcher/tree/main/Scripts 
3. A mod from here. Download a zip of this directory, extract its contents. Each mod has two folders, an install folder and an uninstall folder. 


Step 1: Go to your data.win file for your game. You can find this file along this path "[...]:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\[_GAME_]\data.win". Make a backup of this file. REPEAT: Make a backup. Save your backup outside this path (such as to your desktop). This is your insurance in case something breaks.

Step 2: Open the (non-backup) data.win file of your game in Undertales Mod Tool. You can do this by launching the mod tool and hitting 'file' > 'open' and then selecting your data.win file. 

Step 3: Select 'Scripts' and then select 'Run other scripts'

Step 4: Select 'HGPatcher.csx'

Step 5: When prompted, Select and open the mod directory you wish to install (don't open any of the folders inside the install mod folder). The file name box should say 'Patch Directory." and you should see each multiple folders in the file explorer window. Hit 'Open'. 

Step 6: Wait. It should patch extremely quickly.

Step 7: When complete, click 'File' in the Undertales Mod Tool, and hit 'Save'. Quit the Undertales Mod Tool, and try the game out

UNINSTALLING THE MOD

Follow the directions above but enter the 'uninstall mod' directory instead of the 'install mod' directory. These are present in each individual mod folder.
